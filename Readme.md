# KVPStorage

KVPStorage is used for persistently storing and retrieving key-value pairs, most commonly used to store settings. 

## Compilation

Run make to create the binary. 

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd src
$ ./KVPStorage
$ cd ../tst
$ ./KVPStorage_tst # To test and see results
```

For cross-compilation, use the desired toolchain with 

```bash
$ mkdir build_ARM
$ cd build_ARM
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/buildroot/output/host/share/buildroot/toolchainfile.cmake  ..
$ make
```

Then, copy executable file to emulator or device itself to run.
## Usage

SET		[KEY] [VALUE]

- SET command requires a key.

GET		[KEY] 

- GET command requires a key. Any other input after the first key throws an exception.

DELETE	[KEY]

- DELETE command requires a key. Any other input after the first key throws an exception.

Example usage is given below:
```bash
$ ./KVPStorage
> SET DeviceName TestDevice_123
OK
> GET DeviceName
TestDevice_123
> DELETE DeviceName
OK
> GET DeviceName

>
